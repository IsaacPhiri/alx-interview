# 0x00-pascal_triangle
- `0-pascal_triangle.py` : The function first checks if n is less than or equal to zero, in which case it returns an empty list as requested. Otherwise, it initializes the triangle with the first row [1], and then iterates n-1 times (since the first row is already there). For each iteration i, it creates a new list row that represents the i-th row of the triangle. It starts by adding 1 to the left of the previous row (which is triangle[i-1]). Then, for each index j in the range [1, i-1], it computes the sum of the corresponding elements in the previous row (triangle[i-1][j-1] and triangle[i-1][j]) and adds it to the new row. Finally, it adds 1 to the right of the row and appends it to the triangle. After all iterations are done, the function returns the complete triangle.
